# ROOT ME

This are the web server and web client challenges of Root Me. Some of the challenges I posted had already been done. But i wanted to upload them so that you can go solving by yourselves with the solution from the easiest level.

As other challenges, we have to find a flag to finish the level.

## Web site

I recomendly this web site for starting learning any type of hacking skills because you can start from the lowest level.

Also this site has a big comunity where you can find help for any challenge or give them if you have find the solution.

You can find this site [here](https://www.root-me.org/).

Only you have to do is create and account, select the type of challenge that you want, and start practice.
